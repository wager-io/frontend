      <p>
        Google authenticator could provide an additional layer of security
        protection for your account. It is a software token that implements a 2-step
        verification program. In order to use Google authenticator, you must have a
        mobile phone because it will be installed as a mobile application. You can
        also use Google authenticator when offline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google authenticator uses an algorithm to calculate one-time passwords based
        on time. Simply put, once the application is started, Google authenticator
        will display a randomly generated 6-digit sequence of numbers, ie, a
        one-time password. If you have enabled 2FA in your account, then in addition
        to entering your usual password, you also need to enter the randomly
        generated one-time password. 2FA provides additional security protection
        because it makes sure that others cannot login to your account with your
        username and password alone.
      </p>

        We highly values the security of the players, so we strongly recommend you
        to use Google authenticator. This small extra step could protect you against
        necessary headache and anxiety.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have enabled Google authenticator, you will be prompted to complete
        2FA every time you login or withdraw. Furthermore, please print out the QR
        code or write down the manual code that could recover your account. In case
        of mobile phone breakdown or loss, this will help you to a great extent.
