   <h2>What is cryptocurrency?</h2>
   <p>
     Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that does not rely on any real
     substance and makes use of cryptography, eg. Bitcoin, litcoin, BitShares,
     etc. It is a digital currency that is created, distributed, and maintained
     based on cryptography and validation technology. The characteristics of
     cryptocurrency are its application of P2P technology and the fact that
     everyone issues it.
   </p>
   <p>
     Cryptocurrency is also an online payment system that supports anonymous
     transcommon.actions. Bitcoin is the top cryptocurrency, and is recognised by
     the laws in many countries.
   </p>
 
   <h2>Why using cryptocurrency?</h2>
   <p>
     Due to several reasons, crytocurrency is the most popular and widely used
     digital currency. In contrast to traditional transfer, We transfers never
     require several hours of waiting, and are not affected by the transfer
     amount or the region of the user. The fee is also much lower, and is usually
     a few cents. Refund will not happen to cryptocurrency, and no cheating is
     possible. No bank, government agency, or individual could manipulate
     cryptocurrency. In contrast to traditional currency, cryptocurrency
     transactions are anonymous, and there is no threat of confiscation.
   </p>
 
   <h2>How does cryptocurrency transaction work?</h2>
   <p>
     Cryptocurrency transactions are actually very simple. Basically it is to
     send cryptocurrency from an online wallet to another. The first step in the
     whole process is that the payer sends a private key (a randomly generated
     sequence of numbers) to the payee, after which a transaction will go through
     0 to 5 validations. An ordinary transaction will go through 1 validation,
     but if the amount is very large, it is better to perform multiple
     validations. It takes about 10 minutes for a single validation on the
     blockchain network. After validation, anyone on the blockchain can check
     this transaction but could not see any sensitive information.
   </p>
 
   <h2>How to purchase cryptocurrency?</h2>
   <p>Cryptocurrency can be purchased at the following places:</p>
   <p>
     Market exchange: If the buyer does not care much about privacy, then an
     online market exchange is the best option to buy cryptocurrency because
     market exchanges usually require the buyers to provide identification.
     Buyers could purchase cryptocurrency from a market exchange and store it
     there.
   </p>
   <p>
     Over the counter: This means two people perform a cryptocurrency transaction
     face-to-face. Usually cryptocurrency transactions are carried out
     anonymously between the two parties. Although the face-to-face approach does
     not enjoy this benefit, it is still very popular. Sellers and buyers could
     contact each other through many websites.
   </p>
   <p>
     Cryptocurrency ATM: These ATM are no different from normal ATM apart from
     that the buyer gets a receipt with a certain code instead of cash. By
     scanning the code, the bitcoin will be transferred to the buyer’s wallet.
   </p>
 
   <h2>Is cryptocurrency legal?</h2>
   <p>
     Simply put, the legal status of cryptocurrency is getting better. In the
     past few months, Japan announced to recognise bitcoin as a legal currency,
     and Russia also declared its plan to recognise bitcoin as a financial tool.
     This is a major change of stance for Russia, since bitcoin was originally
     banned in Russia.
   </p>
   <p>
     While cryptocurrency gradually becomes a strong and important global
     currency, this kind of change will also increase. The regulation on, use of,
     and taxation on cryptocurrency still vary across countries. On the other
     hand, new laws and rules are published all the time. If you wish to know in
     details about your government’s stance on cryptocurrency and potential
     changes in the future, please contact a legal consultant.

   <h2>Bitcoin wallet</h2>
   <p>
     There are many bitcoin wallet available. There are cloud-based wallets as
     well as wallets that can be downloaded to personal computers, tablet
     computers, or mobile phones. You can also get a physical hardware wallet
     that stores cryptocurrency. There is a common function among the various
     wallets, which is to transfer cryptocurrency, but each wallet has its own
     merit.
   </p>
 
   <h2>Cloud-based wallet</h2>
   <p>
     Cloud-based wallet is the easiest and most convenient to use wallet.
     However, storing cryptocurrency in the cloud means handing over the
     responsibility of storing to the company that safekeeps your cryptocurrency.
     Therefore, mutual trust between the two parties is vital in storing
     cryptocurrency in a cloud-based wallet.
   </p>
   <p>We recommend the following cloud-based wallet:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>
       <p>
         <a href="https://copay.io/" target="_blank"> copay.io </a>
       </p>
     </li>
     <li>
       <p>
         <a href="https://www.bitgo.com/" target="_blank"> bitgo.com </a>
       </p>
     </li>
   </ul>
 
   <h2>Software wallet</h2>
   <p>
     A software wallet is a downloadable program that can be run on computers,
     tablet computers, or mobile phones. A software wallet is safer than a
     cloud-based one because you can take full control of it. However, a software
     wallet still has its risks.
   </p>
   <p>We recommend the following software wallets:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>
       <p>
         <a href="https://copay.io/" target="_blank"> copay.io </a>
       </p>
     </li>
     <li>
       <p>
         <a href="https://breadapp.com/" target="_blank"> Breadwallet </a>
       </p>
     </li>
     <li>
       <p>
         <a href="https://www.mycelium.com/" target="_blank"> Mycelium </a>
       </p>
     </li>
   </ul>
 
   <h2>Hardware Wallet</h2>
   <p>
     A hardware wallet stores the user’s private key in a secure hardware device.
     Compared to software wallets, one of the main advantages of hardware wallets
     is immunity against computer virus. Moreover, since the private key is
     stored in the protected zone of a microcontroller, it cannot be transferred
     out of the device in cleartext.
   </p>
   <p>We recommend the following hardware wallets:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>
       <p>
         <a href="https://trezor.io/" target="_blank"> Trezor </a>
       </p>
     </li>
     <li>
       <p>
         <a href="https://www.ledgerwallet.com/" target="_blank"> Ledger </a>
       </p>
     </li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Protect your wallet</h2>
   <p>
     When used properly, bitcoin is highly secure. Please always remember it is
     your responsibility to take measures to protect your money.
   </p>
   <p>You should consider the following points:</p>
   <p>Like legal tender, do not put all your money in one wallet.</p>
   <p>Choose your online wallet carefully. 2FA is a good extra guarantee.</p>
   <p>
     Back up your wallet regularly. It is also a good practice to encrypt backups
     that are exposed to the Internet.
   </p>
   <p>
     Store the password in a secure location. You may memorise your password, or
     store it in a secure physical location.
   </p>
   <p>
     Choose a strong password that contains letters, numbers, and symbols, and is
     at least 16 characters long.
   </p>
   <p>
     Offline wallet, also known as cold storage, provides the highest security
     for your deposit. It is to hide the wallet in a secure place that is not
     connected to the Internet. If implemented well, this option could provide
     excellent protection against computer vulnerabilities.
