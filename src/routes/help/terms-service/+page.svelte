     NANOGAMES.IO will enforce immediate confiscation of winnings and closure of the
     account with the right to withhold any further withdrawals. An example of

     spins features and bonus features, to a later time when you have no more
     wagering requirement and/or performing new deposit(s) while having free
     spins features or bonus features still available in a game. In the interests
     of fair gaming, equal, zero or low margin bets or hedge betting, shall all
     be considered irregular gaming for bonus play- through requirement purposes.
     Should the Casino deem that irregular game play has occurred, the Casino
     reserves the right to withhold any withdrawals and/or confiscate
